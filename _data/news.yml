  abstract: New paper explores federated learning to carry out prognostics for batteries without the need to move data
  content: >
           Our paper entitled "Catalyzing Deep Decarbonization : Federated Battery Diagnosis and Prognosis for Better Data Management in Energy Storage Systems"
           has been accepted in Cell Reports Physical Science. In this paper we explore an understated benefit of decentralized federated learning paradigms
           that enables small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to reduce the barrier of entry for accessing sophisticated machine learning insights. We demonstrate 
           SMEs in the energy storage industry can obtain high quality, prognostics outcomes in a fully decentralized fashion without the need to move their data. 
           This is joint work with Dr. Murat Yildirim from Wayne State University and Drs. Susan Babinec, Feng Qiu and Noah Paulson from Argonne National Labs.

           Our paper "The Lynchpin of In-Memory Computing: A Benchmarking Framework for Vector-Matrix Multiplication in RRAMs"
           has been accepted in ACM ICONS 2024. In this paper, we develop a novel, scalable framework for simulating matrix vector multiplications in analog space on
           neuromorphic computational systems. Our framework can be used to develop higher order optimization and AI libraries that can be executed and simulated on
           neuromorphic accelerators. This is joint work with Dr. Murat Yildirim, Gozde Tutuoncuoglu from Wayne State University.
