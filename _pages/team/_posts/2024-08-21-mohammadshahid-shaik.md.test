I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Oklahoma State University, where I specialize in developing backend systems, integrating UI/UX designs, and leveraging cross-platform technologies to build innovative solutions for complex challenges. I hold a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the Vignan Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research in India.

I am a versatile software developer with a strong foundation in backend development, UI/UX design, and cross-platform application development. Currently, I am pursuing my Master of Science in Information and Computer Science at Oklahoma State University. Alongside my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience in diverse technologies, including .NET, Flutter, Streamlit, and SQL Server.

Professionally, I have contributed to projects like PARtyTime, where I focused on database management, backend logic, and documentation for enterprise-level systems. My expertise lies in developing efficient backend systems, implementing data-driven solutions, and seamlessly integrating user interfaces.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I am a detail-oriented individual who values clarity, accuracy, and continuous improvement. Whether debugging complex backend logic, documenting workflows, or experimenting with new frameworks, I am committed to delivering impactful solutions.
