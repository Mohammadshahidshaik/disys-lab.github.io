I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Oklahoma State University and lead the DISys Lab at OSU.

Prior to this I was a NASA HOME Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgia Tech's School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. I worked on using a Vertical Federated Learning aspects to make future habitats on Mars smarter and more resilient to failures!  

I got my PhD. in Computational Science and Engineering at the [School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech](https://ww.isye.gatech.edu). 
I was co-advised by [Prof. Nagi Gebraeel](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/people/faculty/Nagi_Gebraeel/) from Industrial Engineering and [Prof. Edmond Chow](https://www.edmondchow.com) from Computational Science.
At Georgia Tech my research comprised of asynchronous solutions to large-scale decentralized optimization problems with applications to power systems, machine learning and linear solvers.
I also explored the use of blockchain as a decentralization tool. Turns out, it has some interesting features that can be leveraged to reduce costs and improve privacy as compared to cloud based alternatives for IIoT analytics!
